# Hi! 👋🏼
## This is my simple weather app for mobile device using React.JS

Take a look of it using this link https://sage-cranachan-1ae1d8.netlify.app/. And if you wanna play around with this simple overview, then you can use my repo and run the development server:

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd react-weather-app
npm i
npm start
```

## Resources

I uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

This project is deployed with Netlify.
I used https://openweathermap.org/api API for this project. 

- [ReactJs](https://react.dev/learn) - ReactJS features and API.
